# About-U8glib-for-1284P-Arduino-1.0.4
Sir, I am trying to upload Marlin to Atmega1284P with Arduino 1.0.4. LCD is working only when I am updating online by going to "Library Manager" where the updated libraries are coming in "Contributed". There are two ways for library addition.    1.    Through Library Manager      2 .     By copying library into library folder of arduino.    For me its working only when I am updating through Library Manager Online that too for LCD display. Please tell me what I should do for LCD to be work by copying library into library folder. I am using Olikraus u8glib.
